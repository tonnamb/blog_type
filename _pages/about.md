Hi there! Glad to see you here.

I'm a data scientist, working to create a healthier world with UnitedHealth Group. 

Some other things about me:

* I was born and raise Thailand 🇹🇭
* Currently, I live in Washington DC 🇺🇸
* Aside from coding 💻 and math 𝝅, I also love music 🎧, dance 🕺, and learning new things 😀

I'd love to get to know you too! So, please reach out via LinkedIn or email and we can connect.
